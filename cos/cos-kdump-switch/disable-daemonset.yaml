# Deploy this DaemonSet to disable hyper-threading on the nodes with the
# "cloud.google.com/gke-smt-disabled=true" label.
#
# WARNING: Disabling hyper-threading might have severe performance impact on
# your clusters and application. Please ensure that this is acceptable before
# deploying this to your production clusters.
#
# WARNING: Disabling hyper-threading requires node reboot. Therefore, in order
# to avoid disrupting your workloads, it is recommended to create a new node
# pool with the "cloud.google.com/gke-smt-disabled=true" label in your cluster,
# deploy the DaemonSet to disable hyper-threading in that node pool, and then
# migrate your workloads to the new node pool.
